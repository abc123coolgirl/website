<body>            

<center> I have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Health Care Management with a focus in Chemistry. <br> Recently, I have been inspired by programming and have knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Python. <br> In my free time, you can find me learning how to program <I> (Hope you you like my little website)</I> <br> as well as attempting to be fluent in Spanish. If I am not doing either of those, I am probably hanging out with my cat, Hani. <br> Additionally, I am bilingual and speak English and Arabic.
<br>
I thrive in rapidly growing my knowledge in technology and health care. I am always looking for new opportunities.  </center>  <p>
